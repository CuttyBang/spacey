# spacey
SPACEY! is a model of gravitational physics in outerspace. Bodies orbit around other bodies and gravity is illustrated with sound. This is mostly an
exercise in the power of Web Audio. There's lots of nuance going on where Web Audio is concerned. A sizeable audio graph painstakingly chained, sidechained and 
routed to the place it is now. 
Physics is handled by VelocityJS, and it's all drawn to HTMLCanvas. This is v1.5.
SPACEY! v2.0 is on it's way as well!
