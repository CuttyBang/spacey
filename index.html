          <strong>Spacey!</strong> is a demonstration of gravity acting on bodies in the vacuum of space.<br> Except here, gravity is represented
          with sound. To achieve this, I used HTML Canvas, and the WebAudio API, with a bit of PhysicsJS to help things out.<br> The audio is
          dynamically created using WebAudio, and the sound shaping is controlled entirely by the movement of the bodies. When the user creates
          a new body, a new oscillator is created via an "oscFactory" function. Each new oscillator is routed natively through it's own Gain,
          Wave Shaper algorithm, and lowpass BiQuad Filter nodes at the time of creation, and is in turn chained into the audio graph via the
          output of it's filter node.<br> The audio graph has multi node routing with dual sidechaining sends that feed signal directly to the
          main output as well as back into the audio channel for further shaping control. There are two preamps, two BiQuad Filters (highpass & lowpass),
          a "Dub" delay, and convolver algorithm that feed into a low threshold/variable ratio Dynamics Compression node and postamp.<br>
          The sound is shaped through values returned from a proximity equation, based on Pythagorean principles. The locations of the orbiting
          bodies relative to the high-mass body they orbit, as well as their velocities control various aspects of the audio graph's nodes(filter sweep,
          resonance modulation, ratio clamping, etc.). The size and mass of the orbiting bodies determine the ocillator frequency.<br>
          For all that goes into it, it's pretty simple to use:<br>To create a planet, just hit the <strong>SPACE BAR</strong>.<br>To remove a planet
          press the <strong>'P'</strong> key.<br>To kill the sound all together, hit the <strong>'Q'</strong>key.<br>Click and hold in empty space,
          and the planets will coalesce around the cursor, and if you move the "sun", the planets will follow.<br>
          ENJOY! I hope you like it.
